### GMAIL Notifications

If you consider the information the user supplied in the `about` field is insufficient, you can send an email automatically to request more.

This is an optional feature.

Current version configures a GMAIL server to send emails. In order to supply a valid email address and password, run the app wit suppying the sender email address and password as system properties.

./gradlew -DGMAIL_EMAIL=XXXX -DGMAIL_PASSWORD=XXXX server:bootRun

Note: first email may trigger gmail security warning and you may have to set your gmail account to allow less secure apps in order to get the email to send.
