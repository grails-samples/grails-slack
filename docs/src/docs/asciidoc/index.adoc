= Slack Inviter

This project is a Grails application to moderate and approve users before they can join your Slack channel. When a user
requests to join Slack, a message is posted into a private Slack channel with two buttons to approve or reject the
request. If approved the application sends an Slack invitation email to the user to join in.

== Configuration

=== Slack configuration

- Create a new *private* channel in Slack. This channel will be used to receive the requests from the users. Take a look
at the channel id in your browser URL because you will need this later.

- Configure the permissions. Click on _Interactive Components_, enable the option and set the _Request URL_ to the
domain in which you plan to deploy the Grails application. Keep in mind that the url needs to finish with
`api/slack`. Slack will send a POST request to this URL when you click on the _Approve_ or _Reject_ buttons on
the user request.

- Select _OAuth & Permissions_ on the left menu and add the scope _Send messages as user_. This permission is necessary
to send the message with the user information to the channel.

- Create a https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens[Legacy Token] for sending the invites to the users
after they have been approved. It is recommended to use another new user for this instead of using your own user.
